# Profiles moved

"Legacy" device profiles have been migrated to a new format.

The new repository of devices and profiles can be found here:

https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter.github.io

If you'd like to submit a profile you generated, create a pull request **to the repo above**, not `tuya-cloudcutter`.
