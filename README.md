# Tuya Cloudcutter

This repository contains the toolchain to exploit a wireless vulnerability that can jailbreak some of the latest smart devices built under various brand names by Tuya. The vulnerability as well as the exploitation tooling was created by Khaled Nassar and Tom Clement with support from Jilles Groenendijk.

Our tool disconnects Tuya devices from the cloud, allowing them to run completely locally. Additionally, it can be used to flash custom firmware to devices over-the-air (this part is still being polished and is a WIP, check here later to see if it's added!).
